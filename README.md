NOTE TO ASSESSOR: I only realised close to the end of the programme that the portfolio project was meant to be on an application specifically within my industry. As a substitute for this, I have included my capstone project files and based the readme, datasheet and model on that instead. My apologies for the confusion, but hopefully this will at least partially suffice for credit in Required Activity 25.3. 

Non-technical writeup:
In this portfolio project for the professional certificate in artificial intelligence and machine learning, I created a submission for the 2020 NeurIPS Competition with the title, ‘Find the best black-box optimiser for machine learning’. The submission focuses on using two well-established machine learning methods, namely Bayesian Optimisation and Random Search, to maximise eight different black-box (unseen) functions. The former method was used to explore the datasets provided, whilst the latter was primarily used for exploitation at a specified radius around a given point. Techniques to better optimise intermediary steps, such as vectorisation, were also briefly explored in this capstone project.
