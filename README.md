Non-technical writeup:
In this portfolio project for the professional certificate in artificial intelligence and machine learning, I created a submission for the 2020 NeurIPS Competition with the title, ‘Find the best black-box optimiser for machine learning’. The submission focuses on using two well-established machine learning methods, namely Bayesian Optimisation and Random Search, to maximise eight different black-box (unseen) functions. The former method was used to explore the datasets provided, whilst the latter was primarily used for exploitation at a specified radius around a given point. Techniques to better optimise intermediary steps, such as vectorisation, were also briefly explored in this capstone project.
